    <h3>Overview of Statistics</h3>
    <p>This interactive map shows where crashes happened in the 2024 calendar year.
        Although many points are shown at default, users can filter crashes based 
        on the type of injury sustained as a result of the crash: serious, minor, and 
        possible injury. As a result, these different types of injuries are also 
        represented with a different color. By filtering for only crashes leading to 
        serious injuries, we see that a majority of these crashes happen on major highways 
        and roads, instead of residential areas. In addition, it seems like the weather 
        conditions do not seem to have an affect on the severity of these crashes whatsoever 
        because some of these crashes happened in clear weather. On the map, this is 
        represented by solid color lines like pink and yellow. Some recurring roads that have 
        had serious injuries take place include Georgia Avenue, Frederick Road, and Eisenhower 
        Memorial Highway. It makes sense that more serious injuries would happen on these 
        types of roads, but it’s important to acknowledge this to further investigate what 
        can be done on the roads to minimize the number of crashes that lead to fatal or 
        serious injuries.

        This side by side bar plot displays the number of crashes that occur in Montgomery
        County based on the weather type and the injury severity sustained by the driver.
        For ease of reading this plot, only the top four occurrences in weather type have
        been included. This type of plot helped us get an initial reading of how much of
        each categorical data type we were dealing with. For example, we see that we have
        many more crashes that occur in clear weather compared to any other weather type.
        From this plot, we also see that there are over twenty thousand crashes occurring 
        in clear weather that lead to either a possible or minor injury. We also see that 
        there are slightly over two hundred crashes that occur in each rain and snow; this 
        could be due to government officials telling residents of Montgomery County to stay
        off the roads in severe weather like this to keep people who don’t need to be driving
        off the roads.

        This is a stacked area chart that displays the evolution of multiple groups' 
        values on the same graphic - visualizing the proportion of crash severities on 
        each date during clear weather conditions over time (from early 2024 to March 2025). 
        Each color represents a different severity level, and the vertical axis shows the 
        proportion (%) of crashes on that specific day. This graph focuses mostly on clear 
        weather, as it has the most occurrences of car crashes in the past year. The x-axis 
        represents a time series of clear weather conditions from early 2024 to March 2025, 
        while the y-axis portrays the percentage of crashes (0-100%) attributed to each 
        severity level on a given day. The legend on the top right shows the 5 common severity
        levels: fatal injury (very rare), no apparent injury (dominates the graph), possible 
        injury, suspected minor injury, and suspected serious injury (not as common as minor 
        injury but more common than fatal). Possible injury represents data that have not yet 
        been classified as minor or serious injuries but are most likely under one of those 
        categories.

        This heatmap depicts the proportion of accidents which resulted in major injury or fatality
        for different weather types (displayed on the y-axis) and vehicle age (displayed on the x-axis).
        This plot demonstrates a significantly greater risk for individuals driving older vehicles
        to sustain significant injury in the event of a crash. Perhaps counterintuitively, this graph
        also suggests that older cars do not see a decrease in safety relative to newer cars in
        more extreme weather, like snow and rain. The data suggests that, instead, the difference
        in major injury likelihood between newer and older cars decreases.
